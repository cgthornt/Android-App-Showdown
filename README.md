Android App Showdown
====================
This was my entry for the Avnet Android App Showdown!

To use, download and set up an Eclipse environment. Once you download this project, you need to create
an emulator and upload the `IMPORT THIS FILE.txt` file.

## About this Project
This was the [winning entry for the Avnet Android App Showdown](http://cidse.engineering.asu.edu/christopher-thornton-wins-android-app-showdown-at-avnet-tech-games/)
challenge. The challenge was to create an Android app that would be able to import a log file and display
a report.
